# msft-workshop-sdp-copilotstudio-and-azure
Repository to store training artifacts for a workshop on Copilot Studio integrated with Azure resources

Build Intelligent Agents with Copilot Studio and integrate them with Azure
Dive into Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure to create custom AI agents that leverage enterprise data, automate workflows, and connect to external services.
Designed for developers, technical specialists, and solution architects, this hands-on lab guides you through building Copilot Studio agents that interact with Azure Blob Storage, Azure AI Search, REST APIs, and Microsoft Fabric. You’ll learn to orchestrate agent flows, integrate real-time analytics, and extend agent capabilities with custom actions and external connectors—all with minimal code.

What will be covered:
Building Copilot Studio agents and connecting them to Azure data sources
Creating and indexing enterprise data in Azure Blob Storage and Azure AI Search
Authoring agent flows using natural language, dynamic data handling, and conditional logic
Integrating REST APIs and Azure Functions for external connectivity
Connecting Copilot Studio agents to Microsoft Fabric Data Agents for advanced analytics
Automating actions such as report generation and alerts via Power Automate and Teams

Who should attend this workshop:
AI Engineers, Software Developers, Solution Architects, Technical Consultants, Data Analysts, and Product Managers
Development language: Low-code (Copilot Studio), Power Fx, JavaScript (Azure Functions), Python (IoT simulation)

Summary of learning objectives:
Build and configure Azure resources (Blob Storage, AI Search, IoT Hub, Fabric workspace)
Create Copilot Studio agents that answer questions using indexed enterprise data
Author intelligent agent flows with natural language and logic
Extend agents with REST API calls and serverless Azure Functions
Integrate real-time data and analytics from Microsoft Fabric
Automate business processes and notifications with Power Automate and Teams
